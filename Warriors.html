      <h2>🛡️ Who Were the Spartans?</h2>
      <p>The Spartans were known as some of the toughest people in ancient Greece. They lived in a city called Sparta, which was famous for training strong and brave warriors. From the time they were young, boys were expected to grow up into fearless soldiers. Their lives were shaped by values like courage, discipline, and strength.</p>

        <h2>👶 Training from Age 7</h2>
        <p>When a Spartan boy turned 7, his life changed completely. He was taken from his family and sent to a place called the Agoge. This was a strict school where boys learned how to fight, survive, and stay strong—both in body and mind. They went barefoot, wore simple clothes, and ate just enough to stay tough. Showing fear or weakness wasn’t allowed. The goal was to shape them into the best warriors they could be.</p>

        <h2>⚔️ Spartan Armor & Weapons</h2>
        <p>Spartans wore bronze helmets, red cloaks, and carried large round shields called <strong>aspis</strong>. Their weapons included short swords and long spears. Their shields were so important that dropping one in battle was seen as a disgrace.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Bravery and Silence</h2>
      <p>Spartan warriors were trained to speak little but act bravely. They believed in doing more and saying less. This is where the word <em>“laconic”</em> comes from—it means saying a lot with just a few words!</p>
