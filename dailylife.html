      <h2>Spartan Childhood</h2>
      <p>In sparta, kids were encouraged to steal food, espacially boys. If they were caught, they were punished, not for stealing, but for getting caught.</p>
      <p>Spartan kids were taught to speak little and act bravely. That‚Äôs where the word ‚Äúlaconic‚Äù comes from!</p>
      <p>Spartan Girls were provided with more civil rights then boys, but were still not considered part of the government </p>
      <h2>Food and Meals</h2>
      <p>Sparta was known for its military power and spimplicity. Their staple food was barley, which was often made into bread or porridge. They also ate meat, including pork, wild game, and sometimes fish. A common dish was black broth (melas zomos), made from boiled pig's blood, vinegar, and salt. Fruits like figs, olives, and grapes, along with legumes and vegetables, were also part of their diet. Olive oil was a staple for cooking and added healthy fats. 
</p>
      <h2>Homes and Clothes</h2>
      <p>In daily life, Spartans, both men and women, wore simple tunics (chitons or peplos). These tunics were typically made of wool or linen and could be worn at various lengths, with women generally wearing them to their ankles and men to their knees. Spartans also wore cloaks (himations or chlamys). Spartan homes were typically simple, one or two-story structures built with dried mud bricks and clay roof tiles. They often had a central courtyard. Spartan men lived in barracks until the age of 30, spending most of their time there training and serving in the army. </p>
