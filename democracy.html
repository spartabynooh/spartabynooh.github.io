      <h1>⚖️ Democracy and Sparta</h1>
      <p>Let’s explore how Ancient Greeks made decisions — and why Sparta chose a different path!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>🗳️ What Is Democracy?</h2>
      <p>Democracy is when the people get to vote and help decide how a country or city is run. The word "democracy" comes from two Greek words: "demos" (people) and "kratos" (rule). That means: rule by the people!</p>

      <p>In ancient Athens, democracy meant that citizens (adult men born in Athens) could vote on new laws and help make big choices. They met in a big gathering called the "Ekklesia." That’s kind of like a town meeting — but way bigger!</p>

      <h2>🏛️ The Democracy of Athens</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All male citizens could vote.</li>
        <li>They met in big open spaces to talk about ideas.</li>
        <li>Votes were made by raising hands or using small stones.</li>
        <li>Each citizen could speak if they wanted to!</li>
        <li>Leaders were chosen for short times to prevent anyone from gaining too much power.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Athens loved debate and learning. It was a city full of teachers, artists, and speakers. That’s why Athens is known as the "birthplace of democracy."</p>

      <h2>⚔️ Sparta Did Things Differently</h2>
      <p>While Athens was focused on art and thinking, Sparta was focused on strength, soldiers, and discipline. Their government wasn’t a democracy. It was a mix of monarchy, oligarchy, and even a little democracy!</p>

      <h3>👑 The Kings of Sparta</h3>
      <p>Sparta had <strong>two kings</strong> at the same time. One king led the army into battle, and the other stayed in Sparta to keep the peace. They believed this kept balance and order.</p>

      <h3>👴 The Council of Elders</h3>
      <p>This was a group of 28 older men (over 60) who were chosen for life. They made big decisions and gave advice. They were called the <strong>Gerousia</strong>.</p>

      <h3>🧱 The Assembly</h3>
      <p>The Spartan assembly, or <strong>Apella</strong>, included male citizens over 30. They voted on ideas suggested by the elders. But they didn’t get to talk about the ideas first — they only said “yes” or “no.”</p>

      <h3>🎮 The Ephors</h3>
      <p>Sparta also had 5 special leaders called <strong>ephors</strong>. They watched over the kings and made sure the rules were followed. They were powerful and could even fire the kings!</p>

      <h2>📚 A Tale of Two Cities</h2>
      <p>Imagine you lived in Ancient Greece. If you lived in Athens, you might spend your days learning math, practicing speeches, and going to plays. If you lived in Sparta, you’d wake up early to train in the cold, race with your friends, and learn to fight for your city.</p>

      <p>Both cities were powerful, but they had very different ideas about how to live — and how to rule!</p>
    </section>

    <section class="wrap-up">
      <h2>🎓 Was Sparta a Democracy?</h2>
      <p>Not really. While there were votes and some citizen input, most of the power stayed with a few leaders. Sparta wanted strong control and didn't allow much freedom in decision-making.</p>

      <p>So, Sparta was a warrior society with some voting — but it was not a true democracy like Athens.</p>

      <p><strong>Now you know the difference! 🧠</strong></p>
